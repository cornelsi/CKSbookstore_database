# 📚 Bookstore Database Design – SQL Project

A collaborative MySQL project to design and implement a relational database system for managing a bookstore's operations.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

To build a robust, scalable, and normalized MySQL database that captures key operations of a modern bookstore — including books, authors, customers, orders, and shipping.

---

## 🧱 Core Features

- ✅ Relational database design using **ER modeling**
- ✅ Normalized schema with multiple relationships
- ✅ Secure access control with user roles
- ✅ Sample data population and query testing

## you can also view the ER diagram on:[draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/#G1dRHtsL3XTJ7p-gip6bZ9FJdCO3jjvErS#%7B%22pageId%22%3A%2262w1ztiSb52zXADRJI9T%22%7D)

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **MySQL** – Database design and implementation
- **Draw.io** – ER diagram creation
- **Google Drive** – Team collaboration and file sharing
- **GitHub** – Version control and project management

---

## 👥 Team & Collaboration

We are a team of 3 members working remotely. Work was divided into:

1. **Database Architect** – Designed the ER diagram and modeled relationships using Draw.io
2. **SQL Developer** – Translated the schema into SQL tables and handled database creation
3. **Query Tester** – Validated relationships with SELECT queries

We collaborated using GitHub and Google Drive for version control and resource sharing.
